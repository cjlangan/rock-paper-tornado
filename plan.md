## Website Ideas
- Recreate What Beats Rock, but with a different beginning concept.
    - What Beats Paper?
    - Rock Paper Tornado

### Inspiration
- What Beats Rock?
    - very cool

## Plan
- Make website using HTML and Bootstrap, perhaps a site that makes it for me too.
- Use Javascript (or Typescript) to interact with the buttons on the webpage and send API's
- Write a backend that recieves API calls and returns them with the required information
- Create a database that can store website statistics, and utilise them.
- containerise the entire stack within docker and deploy it.
